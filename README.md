## About Files

1. **File Structure**: The system comprises three text files dedicated to car, customer, and employee databases.

2. **Car Database**: Contains brand, model, availability status, borrower's name, borrower's ID, and due date information for each car.

3. **Customer and Employee Databases**: These files store essential details such as names, IDs, passwords, ratings (ranging from 1 to 10), and fines due for customers and employees.

4. **Execution**: To observe the program execution, run the `crs.cpp` file.

## Assumptions

1. **Input Date Option**: Users are prompted to input the date for actions such as returning a rental car or renting a car. Additionally, it is assumed that users will input dates in increasing order.

2. **Unique Model Names**: Each car in the system has a unique model name. It is assumed that there won't be any two cars with the same model name.

3. **Unique User IDs**: User IDs are unique identifiers within the system. It is assumed that no two users will be assigned the same IDs.

4. **No Mention of Rental Prices**: Rental prices for cars are not explicitly mentioned. Regardless of the rental cost, users are expected to pay the specified value for renting a car.

5. **Assumption Regarding User Input**: It is assumed that users will provide appropriate input most of the time. While the software may prompt users for specific input formats or options, it is expected that users will follow the instructions accurately to ensure smooth operation of the system. This assumption simplifies the handling of user interactions within the software, streamlining the user experience and reducing the need for extensive error checking and validation.
